This repo contains a simple reinforcement learning recipe to improve models' reasoning abilities. It is simple because only rule-based reward is used, the recipe is almost the same as the one used in [DeepSeek-R1](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1), except that the code currently uses PPO rather than GRPO. We have used this code to train small models (7B) on limited data (8K examples), achieving surprisingly strong results -- for example, starting from Qwen2.5-Math-7B (base model), we perform RL on it directly. No SFT, no reward model, just 8K MATH examples for verification, the resultant model achieves (pass@1) 33.3% on AIME, 62.5% on AMC, and 77.2% on MATH, outperforming Qwen2.5-math-7B-instruct and being comparable to previous baselines that use >50x more data and more complicated components. You may check our Notion blog or the Introduction below for more details.

## News
- **[2025/01/25]** We release the training/eval code and our blog. We are working on the paper and will release it very soon.

## Introduction
Many researchers are exploring possible paths towards learning o-style models, such as distillation, MCTS, process-based reward models, and reinforcement learning. Recently, both [DeepSeek-R1](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1) and [Kimi-k1.5](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/Kimi-k1.5) demonstrate an extremely simple recipe on this path, using simple RL algorithms to learn emerging long CoT and self-reflection patterns and leading to strong results, where no MCTS and reward models are used. However, their experiments are based on  huge models in a large-scale RL setting. It remains unknown whether small models can demonstrate similar behaviors, how much data is needed, and how would the quantitative results compare with other approaches. We reproduce the training of DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1 for complex mathematical reasoning, starting from Qwen-2.5-Math-7B (base model), and only using 8K (query, final answer) examples from the original MATH dataset. We are surprised how far the 8K MATH examples lift this 7B base model without any other external signals:

Qwen2.5-7B-SimpleRL-Zero is the simple RL training from the base model directly, using only 8K MATH examples. It achieves gains of nearly 20 absolute points on average compared to the base model. Moreover, it outperforms Qwen-2.5-Math-7B-Instruct on average, and is roughly comparable to the recently released [Eurus-2-7B-PRIME](https://github.com/PRIME-RL/PRIME) and [rStar-Math-7B](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04519) which are also based on Qwen-2.5-Math-7B. These baselines contain much more complicated components such as reward models and use at least 50x more and advanced data:

We are both excited and surprised by the significant gains achieved using only 8K MATH examples. Notably, while the MATH queries are considerably easier than many challenging benchmarks such as AIME and AMC, this simple RL recipe demonstrates remarkable generalization, with performance increasing by at least 10 absolute points compared to the base model. This easy-to-hard generalization effect is something we could not have envisioned with standard SFT training on the same dataset. We fully open-source our training code and details, hopefully as a strong baseline setup for the community to further explore the potential of RL for reasoning.


## Quick Start

### Installation

Our code is implemented based on OpenRLHF. Please follow [OpenRLHF's guidance](https://github.com/OpenRLHF/OpenRLHF/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) to configure required environments and install our version:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hkust-nlp/simpleRL-reason.git
cd train
pip install -e .
```

在安装的时候可能会遇到关于flash attention 使用的问题：
```bash
 so: undefined symbol: _ZN3c104cuda9SetDeviceEi” 
```
falsh attention 需要 和python版本呢 torch版本 cuda版本都匹配

### Reproducing SimpleRL-Zero
The minimum hardware requirement for training is 6 H/A100-80G GPUs (note: this configuration has not been tested yet). To accelerate our experiments, we used 4 nodes, each equipped with 8 H/A100-80G GPUs, to train on 8K MATH examples for 120 steps over approximately 1.5 days, achieving convergence. However, our results indicate that satisfactory performance can be achieved with around 60 steps, which requires less than one day of training using 4 nodes.

The training process leverages PPO with Ray and vLLM for acceleration. So firstly, you need to launch the ray cluster using the command below:
```bash
# launch the master node of ray in container
ray start --head --node-ip-address 0.0.0.0 --num-gpus 8

# if you want to launch ray on more nodes, use
ray start --address {MASTER-NODE-ADDRESS}:6379  --num-gpus 8
```

Next, submit the training job from the master node:

```bash
cd train
# For 4 nodes:
ray job submit --address="http://127.0.0.1:8265" \
        --runtime-env-json='{
        "pip": ["ray==2.12.0", "latex2sympy2", "timeout_decorator"]
    }' -- /bin/bash examples/script/train_ppo_qwen_base_math_lv35_new.sh

# For 1 node:
ray job submit --address="http://127.0.0.1:8265" \
        --runtime-env-json='{
        "pip": ["ray==2.12.0", "latex2sympy2", "timeout_decorator"]
    }' -- /bin/bash examples/script/train_ppo_qwen_base_math_lv35_1_node.sh

```


### Reproducing SimpleRL

Comming Soon！


### Evaluate

We used [Qwen Math's codebase](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5-Math/tree/main/evaluation) for evaluation, but for fairness considerations, we completely prohibited solving problems by calling code. Please follow the `/eval` instructions for evaluation
